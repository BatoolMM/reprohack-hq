# About

Reprohacks are **reproducibility hackathons** designed to provide space to **celebrate** the value of the practice, and also get **practical experience** of reproducibility.

The objective of a Reprohack is to **reproduce results from published data AND code**. To develop a candidate paper list, authors are invited to submit their papers for reproduction. This gives participants the opportunity to work with real published materials, understand what different approaches look like and what they achieve and hopefully inspiration to be more open with their work themselves.

It is also a great opportunity for authors to get useful feedback on the reproducibility, reusability and transparency of their work, recognition for their efforts and and of course, opportunity to engage others with the science itself!

### Many ways to join

You can join as a participant at any ReproHack! See the list of [upcoming events](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack-hq#upcoming-reprohacks) for details. As an author, you can propose your paper for reproduction! Finally, the project is acively under development, so you can also contribute by furthering the development of the Reprohack framework. See the [development directions](dev_directions.md) and [issue tracker](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack-hq/issues) for details.
