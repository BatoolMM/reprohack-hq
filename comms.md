As part of my SSI fellowship I will be running a series of ReproHacks, one day, hands-on reproducibility hackathons, where participants attempt to reproduce papers from published code and data. The first one is on the 27th of June at Carpentry Connect Manchester so I'm looking for papers with published code and data for participants to choose from.

The events are a celebration of the practice of making work reproducible and having run two of therse before, I can attest to actual joy from participants as they delve into other's work and manage to reproduce it!
