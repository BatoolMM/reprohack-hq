---

## What are the Flavors?

1: Your team 
2: Your classroom
3: Your institute or faculty
4: Your university
5: Remote #ReproHack 
6: #ReproHack at a (un -) conference
7: Mix-and-Match

### 1: Your Team

Options:

Codecheck each others work (before submission or before sharing code online) 

Codecheck benchmarks (and share the frustration)

Upside: 
Immediate use
Use existing facilities
Could be done before submission

Challenges:
Convincing colleagues can be difficult



---

## 2: Your classroom

Options
Coursework or hand-in assignments
Peer reviews amongst students
Assignments submitted binder ready

Challenges
Lots of work beforehand (is it more though?)

Upside 
Reproducible assignments are easier to handle
Teaching important research skills along with content


**Join the discussion:** #TeachingByReprohacking and the dedicated Teaching Channel on our Slack

## 3: Your institute or faculty

Upsides: 	
Stay in one domain (more or less broadly)

Similar data (size, privacy issues etc) 

Similar scripting and programming languages

Get to know network with peers outside your lab


Challenges:
	Requires a bigger organizing team




---

## 4: Your university

Upsides: 

Interdisciplinary fun!

Share with people with similar enthusiasm!

Meet people that are in different communities (E.g. ReproducibiliTea)

Challenges: 
organize location, finance
communication across disciplines 
different levels of skills (Stats, Programming, Open Science things)



---

## 5: Remote #ReproHack 

Upside: 

Accessibility
	Expand to international community members

Challenges: 

Tech - can be expensive
Tech - can fail
Special efforts for networking necessary


---

## 6: #ReproHack at a (un -) conference! 

Upside

Part of a large event 
“walk-in” participants
	Within field/ specialty

Challenges:

Requires additional preparation, may need to be presented in submission process


---

## 7: Mix-and-Match

Options:
Keep it to one programming language and interdisciplinary

Cluster around one research topic across domains
